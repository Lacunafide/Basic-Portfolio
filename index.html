                        <p>
                            I was born in Atlanta, Georgia.  The year was 1987, when music was at it's highest with hits like "Here I Go Again" by Whitesnake. I was raised all around the United States, moving every few years, but eventually settled down where I was born. Sadly, Whitesnake is no longer topping the charts.

                            I developed a desire to work with computers when I was very young, and my mother let me play with the dot-matrix and line printer. From that point on I would take them apart, and rebuild them for fun. Eventually I got to building my own computers. When I went to college, I discovered a passion for coding. Not a lot of people like sitting in front of a computer for hours on end, looking lost at what seems like a bunch of garbled text.  But that is where I find comfort.  There, and in board games. Which I should probably mention I collect.

                            I am an avid board game collector, with over 200 titles in my collection. I often host gaming halls at conventions and expos, where I host tournaments and teach people how to play. With it comes all the other standard nerdy hobbies, painting miniatures, building terrain, and role playing.
